# Module 10 Challenge
## Goals
- Analyze and Explore Climate Data using SQLAlchemy to connect to a database in Python
- Design a climate app that uses the analysis outlined above through Flask

## Part 1: Climate Data
- In the Jupyter notebook is code that queries a database using SQLAlchemy.
- This involves querying for precipitation over a date range of a year and displaying a graph of the data
- It also involves querying about the number of stations in  the dataset and finding min, avg, max of a particular station and displaying that data.

## Part 2: Climate App
- Refer to the app.py file for this portion.
- Uses the above queried data and Flask to create an app that can return various JSON data.
